# If you are using a CloudFront CDN, deploy will invalidate the cache as needed.

# Optionally, you can include or exclude specific files.
# See https://godoc.org/github.com/gobwas/glob#Glob for the glob pattern syntax.
# If non-empty, the pattern is matched against the local path.
# All paths are matched against in their filepath.ToSlash form.
# If exclude is non-empty, and a local or remote file's path matches it, that file is not synced.
# If include is non-empty, and a local or remote file's path does not match it, that file is not synced.
# As a result, local files that don't pass the include/exclude filters are not uploaded to remote,
# and remote files that don't pass the include/exclude filters are not deleted.
# include = "**.html" # would only include files with ".html" suffix
# exclude = "**.{jpg, png}" # would exclude files with ".jpg" or ".png" suffix


# [[deployment.matchers]] configure behavior for files that match the Pattern.
# See https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/ for pattern syntax.
# Pattern searching is stopped on first match.

# Samples:

# [[deployment.matchers]]
# # Cache static assets for 1 year.
# pattern = "^.+\\.(js|css|svg|ttf)$"
# cacheControl = "max-age=31536000, no-transform, public"
# gzip = true
#
# [[deployment.matchers]]
# pattern = "^.+\\.(png|jpg)$"
# cacheControl = "max-age=31536000, no-transform, public"
# gzip = false
#
# [[deployment.matchers]]
# # Set custom content type for /sitemap.xml
# pattern = "^sitemap\\.xml$"
# contentType = "application/xml"
# gzip = true
#
# [[deployment.matchers]]
# pattern = "^.+\\.(html|xml|json)$"
# gzip = true

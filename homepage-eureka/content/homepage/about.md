I am a Software Engineer at [Google](https://about.google/) focusing on cloud platform infrastructure.
I work with machine learning workload on high scale computation systems.

I also worked at [Commure](https://www.commure.com/) as Senior Software Engineer more specifically on 
[Strongline Pro](https://www.commure.com/strongline-pro) product.
At Commure I was working on Geo-location algorithms and infrastructure for high available safety systems.
During my time there I was able to develop distributed systems to achieve highly scalable processing of realtime
IoT data alongside Algorithms for three dimensional location calculation.

I received my PhD in Computer Science from [University of California, Irvine](https://duttgroup.ics.uci.edu/) by
building a service platform for health research.
The services were set to provide a solution for health researchers to collect and analyse longitudinal data while
utilizing artificial intelligence for analysis and intervention.
My doctoral project was divided between designing a service orchestration for long term health studies and
building a scalable infrastructure to host this service on.
You can read more about it [here](/projects/zotcare).

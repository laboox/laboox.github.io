I am a PhD Candidate at UC Irvine. 
My research project is to build a service platform for Health Cybernetics research. 
You can read more about it [here](/projects/zotcare).
My research is supervised by two amazing Professors [Nik Dutt](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~dutt/) and [Amir Rahmani](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~amirr1/).

*I am currently looking for full-stack software engineering or data science positions starting September 2023.*
